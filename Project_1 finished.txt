-SELECT A REGION-
For example US-East (N. Virginia)


- CREATE A VPC
From the AWS management console
Services > VPC > Start VPC Wizard > VPC with Public and Private Subnets > Select
Step 2: VPC with Public and Private Subnets 
-> IPv4 CIDR block: "123.0.0.0/16"
-> VPC name: "my_VPC_Project1"

->Public subnet's IPv4 CIDR: "123.0.1.0/24"
->Availability Zone: "eu-east-1a"
->Public subnet name: "Public_subnet_Project1"

->Private subnet's IPv4 CIDR: "123.0.2.0/24"
->Availability Zone: "eu-east-1a"
->Private subnet name: "Private_subnet_Project1"

-> "use a NAT instance instead"
->Instance type: "t2.nano"
>Create VPC


- MODIFY THE ROUTE TABLE TO REALLY MAKE A SUBNET PRIVATE
From the VPC dashboard
Route Tables > "Select a subnet associated with your VPC" > Name "Route_private_Project1"
Verify that in > Routes > Destination 0.0.0.0/0 Target eni-xxx i.e. all the traffic from the private sub is redirected to the NAT instance
Subnet Associations > Edit > "Select your private sub 'Private_subnet_Project1'> Save

- BY DEFAULT THE PUBLIC SUBNET IS OK
From the VPC dashboard
Route Tables > "Select a subnet associated with your VPC" > Name "Route_public_Project1"
Verify that in > Routes > Destination 0.0.0.0/0 Target igw-xxx i.e. all the traffic from the public sub is using the Internet GateWay for communication
Subnet Associations > "Public_subnet_Project1" should be added already


- CREATE A VPC SECURITY GROUP FOR ACCESS TO INTERNET
From the VPC dashboard
Security Groups> Create Security Group
->Name tag: "WebSecurityGroup_Project1"
->VPC: "my_VPC_Project1"
Security Groups > "Select 'WebSecurityGroup_Project1' "
Inbound Rules > Edit > Type:"HTTP (80)"/ Source: "0.0.0.0/0" (means all wildcards) > Save
  This inbound rule means that the we can access the instances associated with this security group via Internet
Inbound Rules > Edit > Type:"RDP (3389)"/ Source: "0.0.0.0/0" (means all wildcards) > Save
  We can accesst the instances via Remote Desktop Protocol (Windows)

Outbound Rules > Edit > Type:"HTTP (80)"/ Source: "0.0.0.0/0" (means all wildcards) > Save
  We can access Internet from our instances

- LAUNCH A EC2 IN THE PUBLIC SUBNET
From the EC2 dashboard
Instances > Launch instance >
Step1: Choose AMI
"Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base" > Select
Step3: Configure Instance Details"
->Network: "my_VPC_Project1"
->Subnet: "Private_subnet_Project1"
->Auto-assign Public IP: "Disable"
Step5: Add Tags
Add Tag> Key: "Name" / Value: "my_WebServer_Project1"
Step 6: Configure Security Group
"Select an existing security group" > "Select 'WebSecurityGroup_Project1' "


Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair
"Create a new key pair"
->Key pair name: "my_Key_MyProject1"
->"Download the PEM key file"

- SET UP A BASTION TO CONNECT TO YOUR EC2 IN YOUR PRIVATE SUBNET


- CONNECT TO YOUR EC2 INSTANCE
"Select 'my_WebServer_Project1'"> Connect > Get Password > Choose File > "Browse to your PEM file 'my_Key_MyProject1'"
> Decrypt Password > "Copy the given password to access to your instance via RDP"

BSSS ??


-PING GOOGLE SERVER
In the EC2 Instance
>Command Prompt > "ping www.google.com" 
Verify that the request is processed and not denied
